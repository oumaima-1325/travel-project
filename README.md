# travel-project
I started this website as a way to inspire and guide fellow travelers, and to provide useful information and resources for anyone interested in exploring the world
to run this project:
1-first you need to open the database fila and copy all the code to mysql
2-upload all the other files
3-change the connection to your current database
4-copy the files into www if you are using wamp server
5-open the html folder in local host
6-enjoy!
